CS 241 â€” LR1 File Format (.lr1)

A .lr1 file has three components:
a context-free grammar
the states, transitions, and reduce actions of the LR(1) machine
a sequence of terminal symbols to be parsed
Context-free Grammar

Same as the CFG File Format with no derivations. The grammar must be augmented; that is, the start symbol must occur as the LHS of exactly one rule that begins and ends with a terminal.
LR(1) Machine

The parser representation has three components:
An integer s -- the number of states in the LR(1) parser. States are numbered 0 to s-1. State 0 is the start state.
An integer t -- the number of transitions or reduce actions in the LR(1) parser.
t lines, each containing one of:
state terminal reduce rule (Rules (productions) are numbered from 0 in the order they appear in the CFG.)
state1 symbol shift state2 (where symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal)
Sequence to be Parsed

One or more lines containing a sequence of symbols to be parsed, separated by spaces or newlines.
